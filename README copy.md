## Tech Stack

This portfolio site is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React powers the dynamic components and page routing in this portfolio.
- **pnpm**: A fast, disk space-efficient package manager. I use **pnpm** for managing project dependencies, ensuring faster installs and efficient management of packages.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable, responsive designs with minimal custom CSS.
- **React Icons**: A collection of SVG icons for use in React projects, allowing me to add scalable icons quickly and easily.
- **Ibelick.com**: (Include a short description of how this service or tool is used in your project—such as if it’s a custom font or image service integrated into the website).
- **Google Fonts**: I use Google Fonts to integrate custom fonts into the design, enhancing typography and overall user experience.
- **Framer Motion**: A powerful library for creating animations in React. I use **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions and interactive animations to enhance the site's look and feel.
- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for backend services including authentication, real-time database, and hosting. It provides a reliable platform for managing and storing data, as well as hosting the portfolio site.

## Features

- **Fully Responsive**: The portfolio is designed to work on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop displays. It adapts using Tailwind CSS breakpoints and custom styles.
- **Smooth Animations**: Utilizing **Framer Motion**, elements on the page animate in and out with smooth transitions, creating a more engaging experience.
- **Interactive Components**: Interactive elements such as project carousels, modals, and hover effects that make the site more engaging and visually appealing.
- **Real-Time Database (Optional)**: Firebase is used for any real-time data requirements (e.g., blog or contact form submissions), enabling a dynamic and scalable solution.
- **Authentication (Optional)**: Firebase authentication enables user login, allowing for personalized experiences or secure sections of the portfolio.
- **SEO Optimized**: Optimized for search engines to ensure the portfolio ranks well for relevant terms and helps others discover your work.

## Usage

- **Customize Content**: You can easily update the content in the `src` directory, including sections such as `About Me`, `Projects`, and `Contact`. These components are customizable to fit your personal information.
